* get the X509 proxy @ switcher.cern.ch, to be able to talk to AGIS

* Fix the messages to AGIS. 
Put them back to config file


* add a check for too short time intervals. 
  We may not want to set a Queue brokeroff/offline when 
  the CEs are all disabled for 10 minutes, for example.
  
  The same minimum time when DDM is down than if CEs are down?


* Fix some Queue transitions:

    - special values MUST not be changed to online:
    
        test -> online
        paused -> online
    
    - decide what to do for the restrictive statuses:
    
        test -> brokeroff / offline
        paused -> brokeroff / offline


    - take into account the AGIS "comment" to decide if act on a Queue or not:

        online + any kind of comment
        offline + set.offline.by.Switcher
        brokeroff + set.brokeroff.by.Switcher
        test + HC.Test.Me
